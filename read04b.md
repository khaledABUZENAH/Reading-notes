Computers are everywhere, they're on our desktops, in our homes and even our pockets, but we don't usually ask : "how do computers work ?". In this article you're about to find out the answer of this question.
 
 ## what make a computer a computer?

 since a long long time, humans have been making tools that help them fix their problems, but at some point someone said why don't we build a too that thinks for us, the first computer ever made was made of wood, but in the 20th century they started using electrical components, these computers were large and slow and it was making only simple calculations, but now you can use them to do whatever you like.

 All computers have the same stages of processing the informations in order to put it in light and these stages are; taking **input**, ***store*** the informations, **process** it then **output** the results. And I'm going to explain each one of them:  

1. ***input***: is the stuff that you do to make the computer respond. Like when you click on the mouse button.

2. ***storage***: all these inputs give the computer the information, which is then stored in the memory.

3. ***process***: the processor takes the information from the memory then changes it using algorithms which is a series of commands then it sends the processed informations back to the memory again and this continues is ready to be output>

4. ***output***: it depends on what the computer is designed to do, like photos, videos or games, and when a computer is online, the output from one computer becomes the input for another and so on.


## How computers work? 

a computer contains  electric wires and circuts that carry all the informations, these wires would be one or off, two options, and that what is called the binary system, it has only two degits (1s and 0s), any number can be represented by 1s and 0s or by a bunch of wires that are on or off, the more wires you use, the more numbers you can store.

So, the computers represent texts, sounds, and images with numbers, and each letter has it's sequence of numbers, therefore, everything you see on a computer is represented by this system. Videos and images consist of pixels, each pixel has a color, and those  colors can be represented with numbers.

## circuits and logic

Every input or output in the copmuter is a type of information which can be represented by on or off electrical signals(1s and 0s). To process the information that comes in as input, and to make outpts, computer needs to modify and combine the input signals, to do this the computer uses millions of teeny electronic components, which come together to form circuits. by connecting these circuits we can do more complicated calculations.

## hardwere and softwere

When you look inside of a computer you see a bunch of circuits, chips, wires, speakers and other stuff, the is the hardwere but what you can't see is the softwere, but how the softwere and hardwere are connected?

The CPU is the master unit that control all the other parts of the computer, and inside it has smaller parts that handle specific tasks, it has circuits to do the maths and other circuits to send and recieve informations throughout the computer, the CPU recieves simple commands that tell is which circuits to use to do a specific job and to move the information to the memory then back to the CPU until the information is ready to the output phase.

Inside every computer is an operating system maniging softwere that controls the hardwere, the softwere is a series of commands made of simple binary codes.
