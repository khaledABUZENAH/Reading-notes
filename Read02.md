## centralized version control(CVCS):
a system contains a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients, but when the system goes down, it causes a loss of files.

# What is GitHub?
Git is a **DVCS** that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. It relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked and protected by Git so it cant be corrupted. It also saves the files and makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost. Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged. staging files means here to organize them.

## the history of GitHub
Before the version than we have here, it was a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002 and is was founded by Linux kernel. in 2005 when many of developers stopped usings this DVCS due to a tension between Linux Kanrel and the company behind BitKeeper. Therefore, Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the Linux kernel, began creating Git and his intention was to create a DVCS with a workflow design similar to that of BitKeeper. Since then, Git has become one of the most famous Version Control Systems in the world.
