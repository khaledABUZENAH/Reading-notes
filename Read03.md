# HTML5 Layout
For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elemets on the page, but this method was kinda complicated, so they startd using the new HTMLS elements that provide a clearer code compared to the old method. HTML5 elements help to describe the stucture of web pages so the majority of the websites started using HTML5.

## There are several HTML5 elements, such as:
* section
* hgroup
* figure and figcaption
* div
* aside

### and I will clarify two of them:

* #### aside:
is has two functions depinding whether is is inside **<article>** or not:
1.  inside: should contain stuff that are related to the article but not important.
2. outside: a container for content that is ralated to the entire page, such as links to other sections or search box.

* #### hgroup: 
To group together a set of one or more h1 to h6 elements.

## ***extra information that you should know: ***
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the
**<!-- and -->** markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
