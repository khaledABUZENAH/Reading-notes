# FUNCTIONS

Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they preform a specific task. We use them to avoid repeating the same statements. In order to make the function perform, tou need to give it a name, when you ask it to perform it's task, it is know as **calling** the function. Some Functions need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task, like if you want to calculate the area or the average, these informations are known as **parameters**. When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a **return value**. There are two methods of using functions, declaring functions and funcrions expressions.

## Function declaration:

to create a function, you give it a name then write the statements needed to perform the task inside the curly braces, then you execute all the statements between the curly braceswith just one line of code, this is called the funtion calling. Diclaring and calling the functions that need information is almost the same, but when when you call the function you need to include the parameter.
