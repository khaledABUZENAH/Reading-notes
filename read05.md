# evaluating conditions

## comparison operators
you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it maight be. The result wil be a boolean.

 * **==** : is equal to, compares only the value.
 * **!=** : is not equal to, compares only the value.
 * **===** : strict equal to, compares the value and the datatype.
 * **!==** : a strict not equal t, it also compares the value and the datatype.
 * **<** :greater than.
 * **>** :less than.
 * **>=** :greater than or equal to.
 * **<=** :less than or equal to.


## logical operators

It allowes you compare the results of more than one condition.

* the logical and(**&&**):
this operator tests more than one condition.
(false && anything = false)

* the logical or( **||** ):
this operator  tests at least one condition.
(true || anything = true)

* logical not (**!**):
this operator takes a single operator value and inverts it. 
! true = false
! false = true

## loops: 

loops check a condition, if it's true, a code block will run, then the condition will be checked again and if it's still true, the code block will run again and again until the condition is false. There are three common types of loops, for, while, and do while:

* **for loop**
![for](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/images/cpp_for_loop.jpg)

A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to write a loop that needs to run a specific number of times. for example, if you want to execute a loop for 12 time, the code will be like that:

***for( i = 0; a < 12; i++ )***


* **while loop**
![while](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/While-loop-diagram.svg/220px-While-loop-diagram.svg.png)

you can use it if you don't know how many times the code should run, the code will continue to loop as long as the condition is true.
