There are several ways to use the colors in CSS, like the color name, RGB, RGBA, HEX, HEX, HSL, and HSLA.

* the first method is just to write the name of the color, such as red and white
* in rgb and argb method, you have to determine three elements **(red, blue, green)** each color will be represented as a number from 0 to 255. the letter a stands for alpha, which sympolozes the opacity of the color, and it is from 0 to 1
* in hex codes, These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a hash # For example: **#ee3e80**
* in hcl which stands for hue, saturation and lightness, each color has a degree for example the red and its degree is 360, green is 120, and the blue is 240, Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.
