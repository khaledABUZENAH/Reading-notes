# Choosing a text editor

## what is a text editor ?
A text editor is a software that you install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor is one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer. Text editors have a lot of features, such as:

* **code completion**:
Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed.



* **syntax highlighting**:
a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an error and you can’t find it.


* **variety ot themes**:
It allows you to change the color of the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text, and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing software as well. It’s good to find a theme that might reduce eye strain and fatigue.

### There are several text readers; for example:

* **notepad ++**:

* **visual studio code**:

In the end, While you can search on Google for the “best” text editor for coding
(and Google will definitely tell you). I think the best text editor is
truly the one that you enjoy using the most. That’s really the best one,
isn’t it?


# The Command line

They call it also terminal,it's a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. The command line presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands. 

## commands

| command     | function|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| pwd     | It tells you what your current or present working directory is.      |
| is   | it lists the contents of our current directory.       |
| is -I  | a long listing        |
| ls /etc  | it tells ls not to list our current directory but instead to list that directories contents.       |
| ls -l /etc  | a long listing of the directory        |
| cd |  move to another directory.       |
| file |  obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is     |
| is-a |  List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.     |


## paths:

***Absolute paths*** specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )

***Relative paths*** specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.
